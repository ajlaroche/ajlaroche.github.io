                <p class="AllAboutMe">I have a Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Florida and a Master's in Engineering
                    Management from the George Washington University. I have spent the last 18 years working in the refining
                    industry in a wide variety of roles ranging from process engineering to project development and refinery
                    economics.
                </p>
                <p class="AllAboutMe">In addition to my work as an engineer, I have a passion for finance and economics. As a result, I spend a
                    lot of my spare time reading and analyzing the financial news of the day. I take pleasure in deciphering
                    insights from the wealth of data available to us from news outlets and government agencies with the ultimately
                    goal of converting those insight to personal investment strategies and general worldly advice. </p>
                <p class="AllAboutMe">I aspire to be a Full Stack Web Developer who is available to perform freelance work for content producers who want to
                    share their art, skills, wisdom, and knowledge with the world. I also look forward to using my skills to enhance
                    3rd party developed websites by improving user experience, adding interactivity, data collection and analysis.
